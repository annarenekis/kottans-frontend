I attended two weeks of the Introduction to Git and GitHub course on Coursera. Most of the information was new to me. It was a great experience to take a learning course in English.

I finished a few levels on learngitbranching.js.org. The fact that the majority of the tasks were for practice also contributed to a better understanding of Git's working principles.

I've previously worked with Git a bit, but I've only used the basic push and pool commands. The majority of this course was new to me, essentially. The sheer number of possibilities provided by GIT is what most impressed me.
